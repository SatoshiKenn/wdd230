        <strong>Maria Guzman</strong>, she wants to start a new food restaurant, she is
        investigating about the different places she could use to put her food
        truck, she moved two months ago with her family and wants to implement
        the same business she had in her last comuna. She's 45 years old. She
        only has her High school education, she already has social networks but
        didn't work too well in her last comuna, she had success because she
        knew a lot of people and that helped her to have more clients. Her
        motivation to visit the program is all the connections we have to do
        good advertising, also she wants to learn how to use her social networks
        to reach people by internet.

        already tried almost every restaurant in his comuna. He's currently in
        High school. He's 17 years old. His motivation to visit our site is to
        have information about new food businesses in his comuna to try with his
